		<h2>Is this production-ready?</h2>
		<p>Not at all. Until 1.0 release, I would consider this framework
		“experimental”. Of course, I have made great effort to ensure that all
		provided functionality works as expected, but at the current stage,
		there are just no guarantees. Still, the framework already provides a
		couple of very useful components which seemingly work very well.
		</p>
		<p>Of course, I highly encourage you to test it out, especially
		if you find that it covers a specific requirement your project it
		currently facing. The only way for the framework to mature over time is
		by developer feedback. Your opinion, suggestions and experiences
		are highly appreciated.
		</p>
		
		<h2>I already have PrimeFaces and OmniFaces on my tech stack. Why should I add yet another framework?</h2>
		<p>Actually, it’s the other way around. Both PrimeFaces and
		OmniFaces are for the most part not really frameworks, but rather
		component libraries. CrudFaces, on the other hand, consists of both a
		component library as well as a framework, however the latter really
		only consists of a few Java classes.
		</p>
		<p>In fact, CrudFaces is the perfect addition for an existing
		PrimeFaces + OmniFaces stack. It smoothes out PrimeFaces experience and
		uses basic OmniFaces components to build even more sophisticated
		ready-to-use solutions on top of them.
		</p>
		<p>CrudFaces addresses any typical JSF project with persistence
		backend CRUD operations on entities. You can use CrudFaces to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Build a JSF application from scratch. CrudFaces will make
			sure that everything basically works and looks good, drastically
			diminishing the need to apply your own hacks and workarounds.</li>
			<li>Use CrudFaces components as a guidance to ensure best
			practices compliance of your architecture.</li>
			<li>Use whatever specific component covers any given current
			requirement in your project, and leave out the rest.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>What’s your motivation behind this project?</h2>
		<p>Years of painful, repetitive work. I’ve been working on JSF
		projects for 5+ years now and I’ve come to the realization that most
		JSF projects are basically the same and basically need the same work
		done over and over again. This clearly violates the “Don’t repeat
		yourself” (DRY) engineering best-practice.
		</p>
		<p>What’s more, when working with a JSF / PrimeFaces stack it
		often feels like by default, things do not work, and if they do, they
		look ugly by default, which is the exact opposite of what I except from
		a modern, developer-friendly framework. So, in this situation again,
		one has to waste precious development time by reinventing the same
		hacks and solutions all over again.
		</p>
		<p>But I’m not good at complaining. I’m better at finding
		solutions. I really want to turn this project into a place where I can
		put my knowledge and experience in, and use it as a save starting point
		to build new JSF projects the right way.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Why didn’t you just contribute your stuff to the OmniFaces project?</h2>
		<p>First of all, these two frameworks have a different focus. As
		explained above, OmniFaces is a (great) library of components which
		work independently of each other and solve very specific problems.
		CrudFaces, on the other hand, provides a set of tools which work best
		in combination for a smooth overall experience. It’s CrudFaces’ aim to
		guide developers towards maximum best practices compliance which can
		best be achieved with a small, but complete solution working as a unit.
		</p>
		<p>Secondly, at the moment, CrudFaces has only just been released.
		Give it some time to become a more mature framework and we can
		talk about moving tools to the OmniFaces project. I wouldn’t dare
		contributing stuff which is quite experimental to that great framework,
		and I feel like the overall quality just has not quite reached
		OmniFaces standard yet.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Why does your project page and the showcase run on a free hoster? It looks kind of cheap.</h2>
		<p>CrudFaces still is a small private project of mine without any
		financial budget whatsoever. If this turns out to be of common interest
		I can imagine opening up a public donation account. Please let me know
		if you would be interested in supporting the project in that way.
		</p>
		
		<h2>This is 2015. Isn’t JSF an obsolete stone-age technology by now?</h2>
		<p>It is certainly true that nowadays, JSF isn’t by far the only
		available option to create modern high quality web applications, and
		that’s a good thing. However, it is still a viable option especially if
		you can’t effort exposing your backend API or your HTML rendering to
		the web (as is typically the case with modern JavaScript-based
		solutions such as AngularJS), and if you want to keep the maturity,
		security and existing expertise a Java environment offers.
		</p>
		<p>I’ve seen people turning down JSF because of a lack of
		understanding of underlying concepts, such as REST, and their proper
		application. Lack of understanding should not be a reason to give up a
		technology because even if you move on, you may encounter the same
		problems with a different platform.
		</p>
		
		<h2>This looks interesting. How can I contribute?</h2>
		<p>To be honest, I haven’t made any plans for public
		contributions to this project yet. However, I’m open to accept
		contributions. Most certainly, you can already hand in bug reports or
		feature requests (as long as they seem to match the overall project
		goal). If you spot a bug and find a solution for it, feel free to open
		a pull request. Please let me know whether you would be interested in
		joining the project in mid / long term.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Who’s that guy wearing the bear skin?</h2>
		<p>This is Org; he is CrudFaces’ mascot. The story goes that he
		invented the wheel after a small, marble-shaped meteorite fragment hit
		his head.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Is there anything else you’d like to say?</h2>
		<p>Yes, I’d like to thank Bauke Scholtz (BalusC) and Arjan Tijms
		from OmniFaces not only for their marvelous work on that excellent
		framework, but also for generously sharing their JSF knowledge about
		the JSF technology through their project source code, their articles
		and their innumerable stackoverflow contributions. I have learnt a
		great deal about JSF by studying what they have posted, and without
		what I have learnt from them, I don’t think I would have been able to
		build CrudFaces.
